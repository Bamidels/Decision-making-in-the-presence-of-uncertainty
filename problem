The problem that we are trying to solve here is to understand "Decision making in the presence of uncertainty".
Problem:  Multi-step investment decision.
Assume you have to invest 10K for 2 investment periods. Your options are the stock market
and the bank. The probability of a stock going up in the first period is: 0.4. The probability
of a stock going up in the second period depends on the first period stock outcomes and
equal: P(2nd = up|1st = up) = 0.35 and P(2nd = up|1st = down) = 0.45. The monetary
returns for different scenarios are defined as follows:
(A1: stock, S1: up, A2: stock, S2: up): 22K
(A1: stock, S1: up, A2: stock, S2: down): 12.5K
(A1: stock, S1: up, A2: bank, S2: any): 14.5K
(A1: stock, S1: down, A2: stock, S2: up): 11K
(A1: stock, S1: down, A2: stock, S2: down): 6K
(A1: stock, S1: down, A2: bank, S2: any): 8K
(A1: bank, S1: any, A2: stock, S2: up): 13.5K
(A1: bank, S1: any, A2: stock, S2: down): 8K
(A1: bank, S1: any, A2: bank, S2: any): 10.5K
where A1 denotes action 1, S1 the movement of the stock in period 1, A2 action 2 and S2
the movement of the stock in period 2.
Part a. Draw the decision tree for the problem based on the above specs.
Part b. Assume you want to maximize the expected monetary value of the investment.
Perform the calculations that let you decide on the best investment option, Highlight the
optimal choices/actions to be taken by the decision maker.
