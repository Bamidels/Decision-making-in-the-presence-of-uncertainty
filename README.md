# Decision-making-in-the-presence-of-uncertainty
This project uses a decision tree in Python to navigate uncertainty in a two-stage investment. By calculating EMV and Expected Utility, it pinpoints optimal strategies, showcasing AI's power in practical decision-making.
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of decision trees to navigate investment choices under uncertainty. Using Python, it calculates the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) and Expected Utility to determine optimal investment strategies. This encapsulates the essence of artificial intelligence in enhancing decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

## Problem Statement
The challenge of making informed decisions in the face of uncertain outcomes is omnipresent across various sectors. Whether it is finance, healthcare, or personal choices, the ability to predict and plan for multiple potential futures is invaluable. This project focuses on a two-period investment scenario, where choices and their subsequent results are uncertain and probabilistic in nature.

## Decision Tree Analysis
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each node represents a choice between alternatives, and each branch represents a possible outcome. This tool is particularly useful for breaking down complex decisions into simpler, manageable parts and for visualizing the decision-making process.

## Python Implementation
We have implemented the decision tree using Python, a programming language known for its simplicity and powerful libraries. The script uses probability values and outcome scenarios to compute the EMV and Expected Utility, guiding users towards the most beneficial investment decision according to their risk preferences.

## Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
EMV is a calculated average of all possible outcomes, where each outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. It is a critical metric in financial decision-making, providing a single value that represents the average expected return on an investment.

## Expected Utility
Expected Utility Theory is a framework used to model preferences concerning risky or uncertain choices. It considers the utility of money, acknowledging that the subjective value of income is not linear but tends to exhibit diminishing returns.

## Application and Significance
The methodologies and analyses showcased in this project are not just theoretical exercises. They have profound implications in real-world scenarios, enabling entities and individuals to make decisions that can lead to optimized outcomes in uncertain situations.

## Conclusion
This project is a testament to the synergy between artificial intelligence and decision-making. It is a step towards more sophisticated, informed, and calculated decision-making processes, with the potential to revolutionize strategies in any field that deals with uncertainty.

## Future Work
Moving forward, the project can be expanded to incorporate more complex scenarios with additional options and longer time horizons. Integration with real-time data feeds and the application of machine learning could further enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
